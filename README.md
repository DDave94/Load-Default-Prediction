# Load-Default-Prediction
Using customer information to determine the likelihood that they will default on their loan. For this task, both machine learning and deep learning approaches were used and compared. In addition, several text preprocessing techniques such as text lemmitization, case normalization, stop words removal, pattern removal, and more were performed to understand the impact on the performance of both deep learning and machine learning models. Initial EDA can be found within the machine learning notebook.
